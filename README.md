<h2>Hi, I'm Ahmed and I'm a senior unity developer | unity tool developer | shader artist in the making. </h2>

I am someone who has an innate passion for learning how to make stuff look cool and telling stories through video games.

I have over 5 years of work experience developing and maintaining a wide variety of video game genres, especially mobile games. (for example, hybrid, hyper-casual, and casual games).

I love to learn about shaders, computer graphics, and procedural animations.

ðŸ’¬ Now:
- Full time unity Developer at Tarboosh Games | Voodoo 
- In my free time, I am focused on learning to be a shader wizard and a Unity tool developer.
